The iPhone SDK includes an IOKit framework, however it is missing the headers.
To correct this, copy the folder /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator2.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework/Versions/A/Headers
to /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS2.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/IOKit.framework/Versions/A/Headers

MobileLastFM will now build for both iPhoneOS and iPhoneSimulator
